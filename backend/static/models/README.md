# 3D Models Directory

This directory contains all the 3D model files that are served by the Flask backend.

## Supported File Formats

- `.obj` - Wavefront OBJ
- `.gltf` - GL Transmission Format
- `.glb` - Binary GL Transmission Format
- `.fbx` - Filmbox

## How to Add Models

You can add 3D model files directly to this directory. The application will automatically detect and display them when the server starts.

Alternatively, you can use the web interface to upload models through your browser.

## Naming Convention

While not required, it's recommended to use descriptive names for your model files, such as:

- `chair_wooden.glb`
- `car_sports_red.obj`
- `building_modern_office.fbx`

This helps with organization and makes it easier to identify models in the web interface.
